# The Rule of Six

So, if the goal is as few cuts as possible, when you haveto make a cut, what is it that makes it a good one?

three-dimensional continuity

> In shot A, a man opens a door, walks halfway across the room, and then the film cuts to the next shot, B, picking him up at that same halfway point and continuing with him the rest of the way across the room, where he sits down at his desk, or something.

For many years, particularly in the early years of sound film, that was the rule.

I actually place this three-dimensional continuity at the bottom of a list of six criteriafor what makes a good cut. 

At the top of the list is Emotion-*How do you want the audience to feel?*

An ideal cut (for me) is the one that satisfies all the following six criteria at once: 

1) it is true to the **emotion** of the moment; 

2) it advances the **story**;

 3) it occurs at a moment that is **rhythmically** interesting and “right”; 

4) it acknowledges what you might call “**eye-trace**”—the concern with the location and movement of the audience’s focus of interest within the frame; 

5) it respects “planarity”—the grammar of three dimensions transposed by photography to two (the questions of stage-line, etc.);

 6) and it respects the **three-dimensional continuity** of the actual space (where people are in the room and in relation to one another).

If you find you have to sacrifice certain of those six things to make a cut, sacrifice your way up, item by item, from the bottom.

Notice that the top two on the list (emotion and story) are worth far more than the bottom four (rhythm, eye-trace, planarity, spatial continuity),

under most circumstances, the top of the list—emotion—is worth more than all five of the things underneath it.

those top three things on the list—emotion, story, rhythm—are extremely tightly connected.

Most of the time you will be able to satisfy all six criteria
