# Seeing Around the €dge of the Frame

The film editor can at the same time have a tremendous influence on the film.

The editor, on the other hand, should try to see only what’s on the screen, as the audience will.

And so you try as hard as you can to separate out what you wish from what is actually there, never abandoning your ultimate dreams for the film, but trying as hard as you can to see what is actually on the screen.
