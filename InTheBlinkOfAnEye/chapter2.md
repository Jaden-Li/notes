# Why Do Cuts Work?

Each frame is a displacement from the previous one—it is just that in a continuous shot,the space/time displacement from frame to frame is small enough (twenty milliseconds) for the audience to see it as motion within a contextrather than as twenty-four different contexts a second.

On the other hand, when the visual displacement is great enough (as at the moment of the cut), we are forced to re-evaluate the new image as a different context: miraculously, most of the time we have no problem in doing this.

The displacement of the image is neither motion nor change of context, and the collision of these two ideas produces a mental jarring—a jump— that is comparatively disturbing.5

**Discontinuity** is King: It is the central fact during the production phase of filmmaking, and almost all decisions are directly related to it in one way or another— how to overcome its difficulties and/or how to best take advantage of its strengths.6

The other consideration is that even if everything wereavailable simultaneously, it is just very difficult to shoot long, continuous takes and have all the contributing elements work each time. 



On the other hand, apart from matters of convenience, discontinuity also allows us to choose the best camera angle for each emotion and story point, which we can edit together for a cumulatively greater impact.

cutting is in and for itself—bythe very force of its paradoxical suddenness—a positive influence in the creation of a film. 

So the central fact of all this is that **cuts do work.**
