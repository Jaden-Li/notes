# "Cut Out the Bad Bits"

What makes a bad bit?

why hard to identify

The goal of narrative films is much more complicated 

And what is bad in one film may be good in another. 

把cutting比作DNA

there must be something else—still under much discussion—that controlled the **order** in which the various pieces of information stored in the DNA would be activated and 

the **rates** at which that information would be activated as the organism grew.

My point is that the information in the DNA can be seen as uncut film and the mysterious sequencing code as the editor. 

Each is going to make different choices about how to structure it, which is to say **when** and in **what order** to release those various pieces of information.

The point is not their intrinsic value, but rather the **inadvisability** of changing one’s mind in the process of creating one of them.
