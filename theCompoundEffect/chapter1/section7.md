# Put the Compound Effect to Work for You

- Write out a few **excuses** you might be clinging to (e.g., not smart enough, no experience, wrong upbringing, don’t have the education, etc.). Decide to make up in hard work and personal development to outcompete anyone—including your old self.
- Be Scott—Write out the half-dozen small, seemingly inconsequential steps you can take every day that can take your life in a completely new and **positive direction.**
- Don’t be Brad—Write down the small, seemingly inconsequential actions you can stop doing that might be compounding your results **downward**.
- List a few areas, skills, or outcomes where you have you been most **successful in the past**. Consider whether you could be taking those for granted and are not continuing to improve, and are therefore in jeopardy of having that complacency lead to future failure.”
