- basic methodologies

> *There is **one thing** we can do, and the happiest people are those who can do it to the limit of their ability. We can be completely present. We can be all here. We can give . . . our attention to the opportunity before us.*
>
> *—Mark Van Doren*

objectives for the methods

1. capturing *all *the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you—now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind; 

2. directing yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment;

3. curating and coordinating all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play, at any point in time.

## The Problem: New Demands, Insufficient Resources

Reasons for the problem:

1. Work No Longer Has Clear Boundaries

2. Our Jobs (and Lives) Keep Changing
3. The Old Models and Habits Are Insufficient
4. The Big Picture vs. the Nitty-Gritty

## The Promise: The “Ready State” of the Martial A

### The “Mind Like Water” Simile

Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax.

### Can You Get into Your “Productive State” When Required?

*If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open for everything.*

## The Principle: Dealing Effectively with Internal Commitments

Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed.

### **The Basic Requirements for Managing Commitments**

1. if it’s **on** your mind, your mind isn’t clear. 
2. you must **clarify** exactly what your commitment is and **decide** what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it.
3. once you’ve decided on all the actions you need to take, you must keep **reminders** of them organized in a system you review regularly.

### An Important Exercise to Test This Model

you’ll be experiencing at least a tiny bit of enhanced control, relaxation, and focus. 

> *Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought.*
>
> *—Henri Bergson*

People think a lot, but most of that thinking is *of*a problem, project, or situation—not *about* it	

### **The Real Work of Knowledge Work**

Thinking in a concentrated manner to define desired outcomes and requisite next actions is something few people feel they have to do (until they *have*to). But in truth, it is the most effective means available for making wishes a reality.

### **Why Things Are on Your Mind**

1. you haven’t clarified exactly what **the intended outcome** is;
2. you haven’t decided what the very **next physical action step** is; 

3. you haven’t put **reminders** of the outcome and the action required in a system you trust.

### **Your Mind Doesn’t Have a Mind of Its Own**

### The Transformation of “Stuff”

## The Process: Managing Action

the key to managing all of your stuff is managing your *actions*.

### **Managing Action Is the Prime Challenge**

the real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and what associated next-action steps are required.

Getting things done requires two basic components: defining

 (1) what “done” means (outcome) and 

(2) what “doing” looks like (action). 

### **The Value of a Bottom-Up Approach**

The trouble is, however, that most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. 

a Bottom-Up Approach will provide the best means of broadening your horizons

You’ll be better equipped to undertake higher-focused thinking **when** your tools for handling the resulting actions for implementation are part of your ongoing operational style. 

### **Horizontal and Vertical Action Management**

You need to control commitments, projects, and actions in two ways—horizontally and vertically. 

Horizontal control maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved. 

Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. This is “project planning” in the broad sense. It’s focusing in on a single endeavor, situation, or person and fleshing out whatever ideas, details, priorities, and sequences of events may be required for you to handle it, at least for the moment.

The goal for managing horizontally and vertically is the same: to get things off your mind and get them done.

### **The Major Change: Getting It All Out of Your Head**

*how you were engaged with your world*.
