# Chapter 3: Getting Projects Creatively Under Way: The Five Phases of Project Planning

THE KEY INGREDIENTS of relaxed control are 

(1) clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and

(2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly.

## Enhancing Vertical Focus

vertical focus comes in.you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project or situation under control, to identify a solution, or to ensure that all the right steps have been determined. 

This kind of thinking doesn’t have to be elaborate. But as a general rule, you can be pretty creative with nothing more than a pen and piece of paper.

he biggest gap to be the lack of a project-focusing model for the rest of us. 

when people do more planning, informally and naturally, they relieve a great deal of stress *and*obtain better results.

## The Natural Planning Model

Although the process may seem somewhat random, a quite complex series of steps has to occur before your brain can make anything happen physically.

1| Defining purpose and principles

2| Outcome visioning

3| Brainstorming

4| Organizing

5| Identifying next actions

### **A Simple Example: Planning Dinner Out**

what initially caused you to think about doing it? Your intention was your **purpose**,

Your **principles**created the boundaries of your plan., but you thought within them: standards of food and service, affordability, convenience, and comfort all may have played a part.

what were your first substantive thoughts? That was your **outcome visioning**.

**brainstorming**questions were part of the naturally creative process that happens once you commit to some outcome that hasn’t happened yet. the beginning of the *how*phase of natural planning.

Once you had generated a sufficient number of ideas and details, you couldn’t help but start to **organize**them. 

- Once you’ve generated various thoughts relevant to the outcome, your mind will automatically begin to sort them by components (subprojects),

- *Priorities*
- *Sequences*

Finally,ou focus on the **next action**that you need to take to make the first component actually happen.
